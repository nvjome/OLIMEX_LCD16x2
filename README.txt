A SET OF EXAMPLES BETWEEN OLIMEXINO-328 AND SHIELD-LCD16X12.

In order to get the examples working you have to :

1. Close Arduino IDE if it is running
2. Copy the whole folder "LCD16x2" to the libraries folder of your Arduino IDE (ex. "..\arduino-x.x.x\libraries")
3. Start Arduino IDE. 
4. Select the board (Arduino Duemilanove w/ATmega328) and serial port (check this one in your Windows Device Manager --> Ports (COM & LPT) section ).

After that go to: "File --> Examples --> LCD16x2 --> ...", select any of the presented demo programs and compile them:

	Buttons_And_LCD
	Check_ID
	GPIO
	Int_and_float
	Set_Backlight
	UART_GPIO
	UART_LCD
